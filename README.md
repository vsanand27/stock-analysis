# Challenge 2 - Creating Stock Price Performance
The analysis outlines 2017 and 2018 Stock Performance to help individuals pick stocks with high volume and performance.  The program outlines 12 Stock Stickers that were chosen to track in 2017 and 2018.  The program can easily be modified to including thousand of stock tickers that needed to be tracked given the values are already assigned in the tickers array ahead to time.  The program is designed such that it will go through the worksheet only once and display all values.
